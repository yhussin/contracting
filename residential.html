            <p>For most people, your home is your biggest investment. It can also be an investment every year just to heat and cool. The US Department of Energy reports that up to 40% of the energy cost of heating and cooling a structure is wasted by uncontrolled air leakage. Insulating with sprayed polyurethane foam(SPF) is proven to provide a solution to this problem. Not only are homes using foam more comfortable, but homeowners who choose SPF can feel even more comfortable knowing they are saving energy, with payoff which often exceeds solar panels.</p>
